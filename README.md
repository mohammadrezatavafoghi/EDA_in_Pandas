# Exploratory Data Analysis on World Population Dataset

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python and the Pandas library on a dataset containing information about world population.  
The notebook explores demographic indicators across countries and regions, providing insights into population distribution and growth.

## Dataset
- **File:** `world_population.csv`  
- Contains population data by country, including attributes such as region, year, and population size.  
- Source: (https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PandasYouTubeSeries/blob/main/world_population.csv).

## Objectives
- Load and inspect the world population dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the data (check for missing values, duplicates, and data types).
- Summarize population statistics using descriptive measures.
- Explore trends in population growth over time.
- Compare population distribution across regions and countries.
- Visualize findings with charts (histograms, bar plots, line plots, etc.).

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas   
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files
- `EDA_in_Pandas.ipynb` → step-by-step EDA notebook.  
- `world_population.csv` → dataset used in the analysis.  

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `EDA_in_Pandas.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.  

## Key Insights
- Overall population distribution by region and country.  
- Identification of top countries by population size.  
- Trends in population growth across different years.  
- Comparative analysis of regional demographics.  

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how **EDA with Pandas** can uncover meaningful patterns in demographic datasets.  
These insights provide a foundation for deeper statistical analysis or predictive modeling on population trends.
